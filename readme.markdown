sg_fbx
======

asset converter for Sonic Generation models and animations into an FBX container file.

targeted use:
-	convert models and animations from mods into FBX for later re-usage.
-	FBX being compatible with most engines on the market (Unity, UnrealEngine and CryEngine), assets can thus be reused for fan productions
	-	intended pipeline for *EGG Machina* project (Unity)
